## Problem statement:
The olympic events are the most prestigious sports events known to us. The question many arise how does my country compare to other countries.

By making a visualisation where the user can use a interactive website to make his own comparisons within his interest.

think about comparisons in:
* total medals by country
* medals per capita in country
* medals per event by country
* medals / GDP (?)
* Athletes with the most gold medals nationalities
* medals over the years
