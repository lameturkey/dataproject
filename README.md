# dataproject rough concept

## Problem statement:
The olympic events are the most prestigious sports events known to us. The question many arise how does my country compare to other countries.

## Solution:
By making a visualisation where the user can use a interactive website to make his own comparisons within his interest.

* total medals by country
* medals per capita in country
* medals per event by country
* medals / GDP (?)
* Athletes with the most gold medals nationalities
* medals over the years

the __main features__ should be:
1. Visualisation one
  * total medals by country
  * total medals per capita
  * total medals per GDP(?)
  * total medals in a specific event

2. Side visualisation one
  * compare up to 5? countries over the years
  * compare countries in specific events

3. Side visualisation Two
  * TODO
