# dataproject rough concept
 by Koen van der Kamp: 12466573
## Problem statement:
The olympic events are the most prestigious sports events known to us. Most of us had the question: how does my country compare to other countries?

## Solution:
By making a visualisation where the user can use an interactive website to make his own comparisons within his interest.

![proposed project visualisation](docs/project.png)
the __main features__ are __bold__:
1. __Bar chart__
  * __total medals by country__
  * __total medals per capita__
  * medals per athlete
  * total medals per GDP(scatterplot)
  * __total medals in a specific event__
  * total medals in summer or winter
  * compare continents


2. __World map color of the same data in 1 side by side__
  * continent support
  * click on the world map to add countries to the  other charts


3. __Side visualisation one__
  * __compare up to 5? countries over the years__ (user can pick the countries from the heatmap or barchart)
  * __compare countries in specific events__





### data sources:
* athlete_events.csv [source](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
* other data maybe?

### external components:
* D3
* world map 02 update to d3 v4 [source](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/8e15870eb432a21f0bc4d3d527b2d14f)
